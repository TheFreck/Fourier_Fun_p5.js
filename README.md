# Fun with Fourier Series'

A fourier series is a way of generating specific types of waves by stacking sine waves of various frequencies.

In the 1800's Joseph Fourier figured out that he could create a square wave by adding up a sine wave of frequency 1 to a sine wave of frequency 3 to a wave of frequency 5 to one of 7 to one of 9, etc. The more odd numbered waves the closer the approximation. Be expanding on this method it has been demonstrated that any wave can be approximated to any arbitrary degree simply by stacking the appropriate sine waves. Similarly, a sawtooth wave can be generated by stacking consecutive waves: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.

This project uses P5.js to illustrate how this is done. Remember that a sine wave is simply a circle that has been spread out along the x-axis. Currently square waves and sawtooth waves are supported.
